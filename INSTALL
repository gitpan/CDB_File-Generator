This module requires DBFile, but that is standard with perl.  In order
to work you have to have "cdbmake" installed (part of the CDB
distribution which is included in the CDB_File source distribution if
nowhere else). The tests require CDB_File and so do your applications
probably.  This can be retrieved from any CPAN mirror site.

To build and install the library by running these commands:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install
